Welcome to **My GitHub**! This repository contains the updated version of my end-of-studies projectâ€”a system designed to help retail businesses analyze sales trends and customer behavior. This project includes a website, authentication system, dashboard, and two primary analytical components that provide actionable insights to improve store management. Below, you'll find a detailed guide to the system's features and instructions for setup.
